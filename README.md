## Multiplayer:
The multiplayer is P2P based, and is using [nodetunnel](https://www.nodetunnel.io/) to avoid users having to port-forward. Nodetunnel provides a relay server system. 

## How to edit:
The Project was made using Godot 4.5.1.stable and should be edited with that version. You may have to enable the nodetunnel extension in Project settings.
