# snowo.io

## What is this:
Snowo.io is a multiplayer arena fps shooter in which you have to claim all 3 flags and shoot all other players. It uses P2P Multiplayer.

## How to play: 
[here](https://github.com/Username4D/snowo.io/releases)

## Multiplayer:
The multiplayer is P2P based, and is using [nodetunnel](https://www.nodetunnel.io/) to avoid users having to port-forward. Nodetunnel provides a relay server system. 

## How to edit:
The Project was made using Godot 4.5.1.stable and should be edited with that version. You may have to enable the nodetunnel extension in Project settings.
